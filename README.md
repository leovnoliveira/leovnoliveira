# Hello, World! :wave:

I‚Äôm Leonardo Oliveira, a Data Engineer with a passion for open data and intelligent automation. As an economist-turned-data-professional in Brazil, I believe in democratizing information and building solutions that bridge finance and technology. I currently design data pipelines and AI-driven tools that make financial modeling more accessible and efficient. Every project I take on is driven by a simple idea: use data and automation to empower better decisions.
:seedling: Open Data Advocate ‚Äì Early in my career, I realized how powerful public data can be. When faced with the cumbersome process of gathering financial reports from Brazil‚Äôs CVM (Situation), I took initiative to simplify it. I developed a Python script that automatically fetches and organizes official corporate filings and investment fund reports from the CVM open data portal (Action). This project, Get-Data-CVM, turned a manual download process into a one-click solution, freeing analysts from hours of searching‚Äã

. The result? An up-to-date, pandas-friendly dataset that anyone can use for analysis, reinforcing my belief that open data can level the playing field in finance.
:chart_with_upwards_trend: Financial Modeling Enthusiast ‚Äì With a background in economics, I love translating complex financial concepts into data models. I‚Äôve built automated trading bots and predictive models that bring finance theories to life. For example, I created a cloud-deployed crypto trading bot that executes a moving-average strategy on Binance‚Äôs testnet‚Äã
FILE-TKEPUPIJ7CJTXKJXFHK8M1. The bot continuously monitors market conditions (Task) and executes trades autonomously (Action), which not only proved the strategy‚Äôs viability but also taught me the power of event-driven automation in financial markets (Result). I‚Äôve also tackled risk modeling by training a logistic regression model to predict credit card default probabilities, turning a Kaggle dataset into actionable insights‚Äã

:robot: Automation & AI Agent Builder ‚Äì Repetitive tasks are opportunities in disguise. At my current role with an accounting firm, I‚Äôve introduced AI agents to streamline data processing workflows. From cleansing large financial datasets to scheduling ETL jobs, I design automation pipelines that save time and reduce errors. I‚Äôm particularly excited about the emerging field of AI agent management ‚Äì orchestrating autonomous agents that can handle everything from data extraction to report generation. My vision is to develop AI-driven systems that act as smart assistants, handling the heavy lifting of data engineering so humans can focus on strategy and insight. Every script or agent I deploy is a step toward that future of effortless automation.

:handshake: Community & Collaboration ‚Äì I thrive on open collaboration. Whether contributing to open-source projects or exchanging ideas on data forums, I value the spirit of learning together. I‚Äôve contributed to projects integrating with cloud platforms (AWS) and have active memberships in open data communities like Basedosdados (Brazil‚Äôs open data initiative), where I‚Äôve used their public data lake to solve real problems‚Äã
FILE-TKEPUPIJ7CJTXKJXFHK8M1. If you share interests in data engineering, open finance, or AI automation, let‚Äôs connect! I‚Äôm always open to brainstorming new ideas or contributing to meaningful projects.
